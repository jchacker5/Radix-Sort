# Radix Sort Implementation with User Interaction

## Information

- **Author**: Joe defendre
- **class**: Comp435-002 - Analysis of algorithms
- **Sorting Algorithm**: Radix Sort with optional Counting Sort or Bucket Sort for digit-level sorting

## How to Run

1. Run the Python file.
2. The program will prompt you to enter the size of the array.
3. Then it will ask for each element of the array.
4. You will be asked to choose the sorting technique: either "counting" or "bucket".
5. The program will then sort the array and display both the original and sorted arrays.

## Notes

- This is a school project, no contributions are allowed.
- The program is complete and doesn't have any unfinished parts.
- Error checks have been added to prevent invalid inputs from breaking the code.

## Features

- **User Interaction**: The program prompts the user for all necessary inputs.
- **Technique Choice**: User can choose between Counting Sort and Bucket Sort for digit-level sorting.
- **Error Handling**: Added error checks to ensure the program handles invalid inputs gracefully.

## Example

```python
# Sample run
> Welcome to the Radix Sort program!
> This program will sort an array of integers. You can choose the sorting technique.
> Enter the size of the array: 5
> Enter element 1: 23
> Enter element 2: 1
> Enter element 3: 45
> Enter element 4: 9
> Enter element 5: 12
> Choose a technique: counting or bucket: counting
> Original array: [23, 1, 45, 9, 12]
> Sorted array: [1, 9, 12, 23, 45]
```
